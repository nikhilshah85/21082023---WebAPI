1. Develop an WebAPI for clients / projects
2. Consume WebAPI in front end applications (ASP.net mcv, Angular, react, desktop app, library, static web pages)
	2 approach to consume this
		a. Client side useing FetchAPI (this is an api built into every modern browser) - part of web standards
			we use Javascript/jquery for this
			This is fastest bit unsafe
		b. Server side useing HttpClient (part of web standards)
			this is safest little bit slow than above 1

----------------------------------------------------------------

	1. fetch api is a browser based - javascript built in APi 
	2. returns a promise - easy to use - clubbed with HTML and CSS
		fetch(url).then( ...)
			  .then(....)
			  .catch(.....)
			  .finally(..)

			this is like a try catch block

	3. HttpClient is used with Programming languages like C#, VB, C++ and even typescript

		steps
		a. create a class with properies of data which is going to come from url
			eg. if you are makeing a call to below URL 
			https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts

			create a class PostDetails (any name)
			add 4 properties - getter and setter 

		b. add a collection variable to hold the data (collection because incomeing data is an array)

		c. create method in class to make a call useing HttpClient

		d. Call the method in Controller and display data on a view
